# Personal Portfolio with Backend

This project is a personal portfolio that includes both a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a backend (Node.js with Express). It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, with the ability to submit a contact form. This project also includes a backend setup for server-side processing (though the contact form is not connected to a real database).

## Features
- **Frontend**:
  - A well-structured and responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Sections for About Me, Programming Languages, Projects, and Contact.
  - Tabbed navigation for different skillsets and projects.
  
- **Backend**:
  - A simple Node.js and Express server to handle API requests (future integration possibilities).
  - An API for handling form submissions (though it's not connected to a database yet).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - FontAwesome for icons

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and npm, which comes with Node.js)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A text editor (VSCode, Sublime, etc.)

### Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-with-backend.git
Setting Up the Backend
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd portfolio-with-backend
Install the necessary dependencies for the backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
The server will now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Setting Up the Frontend
The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is located in the public folder. Open the index.html file in your browser.

You can use an editor with a live server (e.g., VSCode with the Live Server extension) to view the website in real-time.

Contact Form
The contact form is set up but not connected to a backend server (database) yet. If you wish to process form data, you will need to extend the backend functionality to save or email the submitted data.

Customizing the Portfolio
You can easily modify the content of the portfolio:

Change the text and images in the index.html file.

Modify the styles in the styles.css file.

Add more projects or skills by editing the HTML.

Connect the contact form to a database or email system by adding backend logic to handle POST requests.

Deployment
To deploy your portfolio online, you can use the following platforms:

GitHub Pages (for static files only)

Netlify (for frontend)

For the backend, you can deploy using:

Heroku

Vercel

Render
