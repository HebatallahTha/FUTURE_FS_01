        <h3>üìç CoinHeatMap | Jan 2025 ‚Äì April 2025</h3>
        <h4>Analytics Software Engineering Intern</h4>
        <p>
          I developed a full‚Äëfeatured Solana Rich List and Wallet Analytics
          Dashboard that transforms blockchain data into real‚Äëtime visual
          insights. Using React, D3.js, and Tailwind CSS, I integrated the
          Helius API to display live wallet balances via an interactive treemap.
          The dashboard analyzes inflows, outflows, and key
          transactions‚Äîoptimized for clarity and performance. I emphasized
          clean, scalable code with reusable components, responsive design, and
          consistent UI styling. I also leveraged AI tools like ChatGPT to speed
          up development and streamline problem‚Äësolving, contributing to a
          polished MVP for investor demos.
